# MTG_GameData
Collecting data on a weekly game of command with a friend of mine.
We have a couple of precons we enjoy playing with and we enjoy recording the results of our games.

## GameData.csv
I keep the bulk of our game data here.
  - Date: Date of the game played in YYYY-MM-dd format.
  - P0Deck, P1Deck: Deck ID of corisponding deck each player played with. See Decks.csv for data.
  - P0EndLife, P1EndLife: This is the end life total for each player. Note, endlife total does not directly decide who wins/losses in all cases.
  - P0Time, P1Time: The duration of each players game in HH:MM:SS format.
  - TotalTime: Full duration of the game in HH:MM:SS format.
  - P0TotalCards, P0TotalCards: Total cards at end of game in player's hand, field, graveyard, and exile. This number does not take into account Milled cards.
  - P0Win, P1Win: Which player won the game. 1 for win. (If draw both players get .5)
